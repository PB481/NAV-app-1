#Identified Gaps

Net Asset Value (NAV) Calculation

-   Swing Pricing

-   Swing price thresholds
-   Applying different swing factors to the Fund depending on the size of the investor flow
-   Artemis have asked if we have the ability to apply different swing rates depending on the size of the Appro/Expro?
-   So if the deal is between: 1% and 3% apply a factor of X%, 3% and 5% apply Y%., Over 5% apply Z%

-   NDC Automation

-   Provide accurate Swing rates, with flexibility to deal with transaction based & MV based charges (eg: fixed vs variable) on a range of assets, as well as standardising
-   End to End Process Reviews - Are there are quick wins or new functionality in GIO / other systems
-   Bond maturity limitations - Ability for GIO to be able to mature at different rates other than 100
-   Bond enhancements - Wide ranging enhancements to bond limitation
-   Dummy Lines - Strategic solution within GIO
-   Accounting Interfaces to GIO - Link Yardi & Investran to GIO

Special Portfolio Valuation

-   Fair Value Processes
-   Clients provide Client Directed Fair Value prices which are currently consumed and played back to clients manually, this is a non-scalable and risky solution, around one of the most risky items we have

Income accounting

-   REIT classification/Special Dividend/Capital Reduction - better accounting of reclassification of income/capital events with respect to SORP and IFRS regulation

Trade Capture

-   Trades - Standardization of trade blotters
-   Transaction Tax flags - Transaction tax flags – can this be accurately reflected in the security static data – thus removing the requirement for NBaT to correctly identify where it should be applied

Reconciliation

-   Reclaims reconciliation
-   Harmonise Custody Accounts - Single Custody Account to remove manual cash transfers & breaks

New Business and Lost Business

-   Merger calculations- would be good if we had the ability to load everything from the terminating fund into the receiving fund at the press of a button.

Expense Accounting

-   Fee/Expense Calculation - Enhance ability to put together complex fee calculations that are not supported by existing GIO functionality
-   OCF Capping.
-   Umbrella Fees

Tax

-   CGT - Appreciate this is currently in scope but will help be a NT offering and removal of MACROS for other clients
-   Taxation Linkages - Better links between FA & Custody to facilitate accurate tax tables and tax treatment

Customised Reporting

-   Reporting enhancements - Improve PRFA capability to allow calculation as well as data provision
-   Regulatory Reporting- Enhance & support regulatory reporting requirements within FA
-   MBOR/IBOR - Be able to complete Performance NAVs and XD NAVS
-   Income Forecasting - Produce income projections for the fund Manager
-   GIO to PACE Upgrade - Remove the need to MR data to be used for Performance
-   FAILs enhancements - Reporting is very manual and time consuming at present with data extraction and manipulation by the Risk partner. FA are aware that TA have enhanced reporting capabilities from the system which are not currently available for FA
